@article{Koenker1978,
abstract = {[A simple minimization problem yielding the ordinary sample quantiles in the location model is shown to generalize naturally to the linear model generating a new class of statistics we term "regression quantiles." The estimator which minimizes the sum of absolute residuals is an important special case. Some equivariance properties and the joint asymptotic distribution of regression quantiles are established. These results permit a natural generalization of the linear model of certain well-known robust estimators of location. Estimators are suggested, which have comparable efficiency to least squares for Gaussian linear models while substantially out-performing the least-squares estimator over a wide class of non-Gaussian error distributions.]},

@article{Richardson2005,
abstract = {The hybrid approach combines the two most popular approach to VaR estimation: RiskMetrics and Historical Simulation. It estimates the VaR of a portfolio by applying exponentially declining weights to past returns and then finding the appropriate percentile of this time-weighted empirical distribution. This new approach is very simple to implement. Empirical tests show a significant improvement in the precision of VaR forecasts using the hybrid approach relative to RiskMetrics and Historical Simulation. It is especially appropriate for calculating the VaR of fat-tailed and highly skewed data, with rapidly changing moments. As an aside, we also introduce a new method for testing the perfomance of various VaR forecasts.},

abstract = {Regression quantiles provide a natural and powerful approach for robust analysis of the general linear model. However, departures from independence and stationarity of the errors can have an extremely potent effect on statistical analysis. Here, a Bahadur representation for regression quantiles is provided for error processes which are highly non-stationary (i.e., for which there is a nonvanishing bias term) and which are close to being m-dependent. The conditions for dependence are based on a decomposition of Chanda, Puri, and Ruymgaart which covers linear processes; and, hence, includes ARMA processes.},

abstract = {[This article considers forecasting a single time series when there are many predictors (N) and time series observations (T). When the data follow an approximate factor model, the predictors can be summarized by a small number of indexes, which we estimate using principal components. Feasible forecasts are shown to be asymptotically efficient in the sense that the difference between the feasible forecasts and the infeasible forecasts constructed using the actual values of the factors converges in probability to 0 as both N and T grow large. The estimated factors are shown to be consistent, even in the presence of time variation in the factor model.]},
